# Cards

## Overview

In Hollow, cards are the building blocks of your workspace. Each card is an instance of a tool, created from its corresponding deck, and serves as a fully customizable element within the interface.

## Cards as Tool Instances

Every tool in Hollow represents a set of functionalities (a deck), and from these decks, you can create cards. Each card is a standalone instance of the tool, allowing you to use multiple versions of the same tool simultaneously. For example:

-   A NoteBook card could be a journal, while another could serve as a task log.
-   A Kanban card could track your personal projects, while another focuses on group tasks.

> Note : Some tools support interaction between their own instances. For example, Kanban cards allow tasks to be moved seamlessly between them.

## Placement and Customization

Cards in Hollow can be freely placed on the grid-based interface, giving you complete control over their layout.

Their placement, size, and appearance can all be tailored to suit your workflow and aesthetic preferences.

### Customizable Properties

Each card in Hollow is highly customizable, allowing you to adjust various properties to match your needs and preferences.

## Why Cards Matter

This card-based system provides a high degree of flexibility, allowing Hollow to adapt to your specific needs. By designing each card independently, users can craft a workspace that is as simple or complex as they requireâ€”containing only what is necessary and designed precisely the way they want.
