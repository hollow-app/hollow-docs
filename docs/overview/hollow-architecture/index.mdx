# Hollow’s Architecture

## Overview

Hollow is built on a **flexible** and **extensible architecture** that enables users to customize and extend the app’s functionality. In this section, we explore the core components that make up Hollow’s structure and how they interact.

## Vision Behind Hollow

Hollow is made to empower individuals with a flexible and intuitive digital workspace that adapts to their unique needs.

By blending creativity with functionality, Hollow aims to provide users with the tools to design and organize their workflows seamlessly, fostering **productivity** and **personal expression**.

With its modular approach, Hollow redefines how users interact with digital tools, making customization and control effortless.

In essence, Hollow can be described as:

-   **Minimalistic**: Every tool in Hollow is designed with a singular purpose—maintaining simplicity by avoiding unnecessary features. This ensures a streamlined, efficient user experience.
-   **Adaptable Workflows**: Hollow embraces change, offering complete flexibility to modify and adapt your workspace effortlessly, ensuring nothing remains static.
-   **Limitless Customization**: From colors to sizes, nearly every aspect of Hollow can be tailored to suit your preferences, empowering you to create a workspace that truly reflects your needs.

## Workspace

The main interface of Hollow is structured as a customizable grid, defined by adjustable `width` and `height` parameters available in the settings.

This grid is composed of `rows` and `columns`, whose numbers can also be tailored to your preferences through the settings.

The grid serves as the foundation for organizing tools within the workspace, determining their positioning and sizing.

## The Deck of Cards Concept

In Hollow, tools are envisioned as decks, and their cards are individual instances of these tools.

Think of a deck as a collection of possibilities—a set of capabilities represented by a tool.

From this deck, you can create multiple cards, each acting as a unique version of the tool.

For example, the **NoteBook** tool represents a single notebook. To create another notebook, simply create a new card from that tool and place it in the interface.

This approach provides flexibility, enabling users to adapt tools to their specific needs without cluttering the interface with unnecessary features.
