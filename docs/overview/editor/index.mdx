# Workspace's Editor

The Workspace's Editor in Hollow gives you complete control over how your cards look and function.

Whether you're customizing the size, position, or appearance, the editor allows you to tailor each card to fit seamlessly into your workflow and aesthetic preferences.

This flexibility ensures your workspace is truly your own, adapting to both your functional needs and personal style.

## Attributes

Below are the key attributes you can modify:

-   Size:

    -   Width: The number of grid blocks the card occupies horizontally.
    -   Height: The number of grid blocks the card occupies vertically.

-   Appearance:

    -   Corner Radius: Adjust the roundness of the card's corners.
    -   Card Inner Margin: The space in pixels between the card's borders and its outer edge.
    -   Content Inner Margin: The space in pixels between the card's borders and the tool (content) inside.
    -   Background Shade: Set the background color using multiple shades of the app's secondary color.
    -   Opacity: Adjust the card's background transparency without affecting the tool's visibility.
    -   Shadow: Apply a shadow to the card's borders for a 3D or elevated effect.

## Card Theme

Card themes in Hollow take customization to the next level.

While the app's editor provides extensive options, themes crafted by users unlock even greater possibilities, surpassing the built-in capabilities.

These themes allow for advanced styling and unique designs, giving each card a personalized touch that goes beyond what is achievable through standard customization tools.
