# Tools & Components

## Overview

Hollow's tools are modular functionalities designed to help users achieve their daily tasks with ease and efficiency.

Each tool serves a specific purpose, ranging from productivity to creativity, and is represented as a deck within the workspace.

Users can create multiple instances of a tool, customize its appearance using the [Editor](/editor) and behavior through thier built-in settings.

Tools in Hollow are built with a focus on minimalism, adaptability, and user control, ensuring they fit perfectly into any workflow or style.

## Core Tools

Hollow's core tools are the tools that are built-in with hollow, the current tools :

-   **Profile**: A tool that displays a username, bio, and profile picture. Since Hollow does not have an account system, these elements are purely for display purposes.
-   **Image**: A tool for displaying images in a simple, straightforward manner.
-   **NoteBook**: A versatile notebook that supports Markdown for easy formatting and includes tags for improved organization.
-   **Kanban**: A Kanban column tool that allows users to customize it's name and icon. Multiple columns can be created, and tasks can be moved between them seamlessly.
-   **WebNest**: A tool for displaying websites via a provided URL. It can showcase the website in a popup or embed it within the interface alongside other tools.

## External Tools

External tools are plugins developed by the Hollow team or any developer who wishes to create something valuable for Hollow users. These tools aim to enhance user experiences by providing additional functionality tailored to individual needs.

This aspect of Hollow is crucial to our vision, as it embodies the core focus of the platform: fostering a community that creates tools and components. By enabling this, we reduce the need for frequent app updates and ensure that Hollow contains only what the user requiresâ€”a space tailored precisely to your needs, nothing more, nothing less.
