# Publish Your Plugin

Once you've developed your plugin and are ready to share it with the world, follow these steps to publish it.

## Step 1: Prepare Your GitHub Repository

Your plugin needs to be hosted in a public GitHub repository to ensure transparency and ease of access for users. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Create a New Repository:**

    - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new public repository for your plugin.

2. **Add Required Files:**

    - Place the following files in the root directory of your repository:
        - `index.js`: The bundled JavaScript file containing your plugin's code.
        - `icon.svg`: The icon representing your plugin.
        - `manifest.json`: The manifest file defining your plugin's metadata and settings.

3. **Include the Entire Project:**
    - Your repository should contain the full project structure, including source files, build configurations, and dependencies. This ensures your plugin is open source and adheres to Hollow's publishing requirements.

## Step 2: Contact Us

Once your GitHub repository is ready, you need to get in touch with us to publish your plugin to the Hollow Store.

1. **Join Our Discord:**

    - Join the [Hollow Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/E66D6G3DQ2) and navigate to the `#plugin-submissions` channel.

2. **Submit Your Plugin:**
    - Share the link to your GitHub repository and provide a brief description of your plugin, including its purpose and key features.

## Step 3: Approval, Verification, and Store Listing

After submission, our team will review your plugin to ensure it meets the following criteria:

-   It complies with Hollow's guidelines.
-   It functions correctly and does not compromise user data or experience.

Once approved, we will verify the plugin's version to ensure it is safe. Verified plugins will be marked as "Secured" inside the Hollow Store, giving users confidence in installing and using them.

After verification, your plugin will be added to the Hollow Store. Users will be able to discover and install it directly from within Hollow.

## Important Notes

-   **Open Source Requirement:** All plugins must be open source. This ensures that users can trust your plugin and contribute to its improvement if desired.
-   **Ongoing Maintenance:** Keep your plugin up to date to maintain compatibility with future versions of Hollow.

Start sharing your creations and expanding the Hollow ecosystem. We look forward to seeing your amazing plugins!
