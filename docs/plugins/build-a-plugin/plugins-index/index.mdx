# Setting Up Your Development Environment

Welcome to Hollow plugin development! This guide will help you get started creating plugins from scratch. We'll begin by understanding the key class, `IPlugin`, and its role in the Hollow plugin system.

## Understanding the `IPlugin` Class

Every Hollow plugin must implement the `IPlugin` interface. This interface defines the core lifecycle methods your plugin will use to interact with Hollow. Here's an example implementation:

```typescript
import { IPlugin, ICard, DataBase } from "hollow-api";

class MyPlugin implements IPlugin {
    async onCreate(card_name: string, db: DataBase): Promise<boolean> {
        // This method is triggered when a new card is created.
        await db.putData(card_name, { initialized: true });
        return true;
    }

    async onDelete(card_name: string, db: DataBase): Promise<boolean> {
        // This method is triggered when a card is deleted.
        await db.deleteData(card_name);
        return true;
    }

    async onLoad(card: ICard): Promise<boolean> {
        // This method is called when a card is loaded into the interface.
        console.log(`Card loaded: \${card.name}`);
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Key Methods in `IPlugin`

-   **`onCreate`**: Handles initialization logic when a new card is created. This is a good place to store initial data into the plugin's database.
-   **`onDelete`**: Cleans up resources or data when a card is deleted.
-   **`onLoad`**: Manages the logic when a card is added to the workspace. You can use this method to render your tool inside the card's container.

For more details about these methods, refer to the [Plugin API Documentation](plugin-api.md).

## Setting Up the Development Environment

To develop plugins for Hollow, you'll need the following tools installed:

1. **Node.js** (v16 or higher): To manage dependencies and run your development environment.
2. **TypeScript**: Recommended for type-safe plugin development.
3. **Git**: For version control and accessing the Hollow template.

Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Create a new directory for your plugin:

    ```bash
    mkdir my-hollow-plugin
    cd my-hollow-plugin
    ```

2. Initialize a new `npm` project:

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    npm install hollow-api
    ```

4. Create the required files:

    - **`manifest.json`**: Defines metadata about your plugin.
    - **`icon.svg`**: Represents your plugin visually in Hollow.
    - **`index.ts`**: The main entry point for your plugin's TypeScript code.

5. Use `esbuild` to bundle your TypeScript code into a single `index.js` file. To simplify this process, you can use the pre-made `esbuild` configuration provided by the Hollow team. Download it from [here](https://github.com/hollow-app/hollow-sample-plugin/blob/main/esbuild.config.mjs).

    Once downloaded, run the build process with:

    ```bash
    node esbuild.config.mjs
    ```

    This will generate an `index.js` file, which Hollow will use to execute your plugin.

## Using the Hollow Template Repository

If you prefer a preconfigured setup, the Hollow team provides a [sample plugin repository](https://github.com/hollow-app/hollow-sample-plugin) that you can use as a starting point. This template includes:

-   A working `manifest.json` file.
-   An example `icon.svg`.
-   A preconfigured `esbuild` setup for bundling your TypeScript code.

To use the template:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hollow-app/hollow-sample-plugin my-plugin
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd my-plugin
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the build process:
    ```bash
    node esbuild.config.mjs
    ```

You're now ready to start developing your plugin by modifying the provided `index.ts`, `manifest.json`, and `icon.svg`.
